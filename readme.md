# Flip
Flip is a logic puzzle game.
By clicking a square to flip its color.
All adjacent squares will also flip on the same time.
Your challenge is to turn all squares to pink.

# Features and Implementation
I used javaScript and JQuery to dynamically handle DOM elements as well as implement game logic. I also leveraged CSS3 features to present popup modals for display game information and implement responsive web design to improve user interface(UI).
