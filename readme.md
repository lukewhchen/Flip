# Flip
Flip is a logic puzzle game.
You have a grid of squares. You can flip a square by clicking it. But when you clicking a square, all adjacent squares will also flip at the same time. Your challenge is to turn all squares flip into pink color. See how far you can go?

# Features and Implementation
I used JavaScript and JQuery to dynamically handle DOM elements as well as implement flipping logic. Each square will resize automatically according to different levels.
I also leveraged CSS3 features to present popup modals for display information and implement responsive web design to improve the User Interface(UI).
Applied Window localStorage to memorize the current level.
