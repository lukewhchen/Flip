# Flip
Flip is a logic puzzle game.
You have a grid of squares.
By clicking a square to flip its color, all adjacent squares will also flip at the same time.
Your challenge is to turn all squares to pink.
See how far you can go?

# Features and Implementation
I used javaScript and JQuery to dynamically handle DOM elements as well as implement flipping logic. Each square will resize automatically according to different level.
I also leveraged CSS3 features to present popup modals for display information and implement responsive web design to improve user interface(UI).
